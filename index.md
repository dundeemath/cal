### Notes
- Dates are listed in YYYY-MM-DD format. 
- Remember that many applications require letters of reference or input from academic staff that must be saught **in advance** of the submission deadline to make a successful and competitive application. 😸 Tip: plan one month's lead time. 
- When dates are known, the current deadline is available. 😸 Tip: double-check the year in the date! Deadlines from past years stick around until new dates are published to aid long-term planning.
